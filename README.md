## PGR301 2021 Exam February Ex02 and Ex03
* NB: **This task was done on a MAC. But I have provided a guide for Windows aswell.**
* NB: **This readme has been structured with the information and instructions around each exercise given by: https://github.com/PGR301-2020/konte , so please refer here if you feel some steps may be missing.**
####Setting environment variables
* To set the environment variable(s) for usage in variable.tf you can run either of these commands in the terminal/shell of the project:
* For Mac/Linux: ```export bucketname=<your bucket name>```
* For Windows: ````set bucktname=<your bucket name>````


Note: "your bucket name" needs to be globally-unique and the bucketname after export is just a placeholder for the given name we shall use later when setting the TF vars.
* Then you do the same for the project_id:
* For Mac/Linux: ```export projectid=<your project id>```
* For Windows: ```set projectid=<your project id>```

Note: "your project id" is the name of the gcp-project you have currently selected, which can be displayed on the Google cloud console website.

* Then to bind the newly created environment variables to the declared variables in variables.tf, run the following command:
* For Mac/Linux: ```export TF_VAR_bucket_name=$bucketname``` and ```export TF_VAR_project_id=$projectid```
* For Windows: ```set TF_VAR_project_id=%projectid%``` and ```set TF_VAR bucket_name=%bucketname%```

####Using your own ServiceAccount and GCP key
1. Go to your Google Cloud Platform console / website.
2. In the searchbar type in IAM & Admin and click it.
3. Click on Service Account in the left-hand menu.
4. Click on +Create Service Account, located under the top-header.
5. Type in your desired Service account name, then click Create.
6. Search for and add the given **roles**: Service Account User, Storage Admin and Cloud Run Admin. If youÂ´d like, add Compute Admin and Service Account Admin, as well. As these two latter will be used in the next exercise. (Note: these last two are not needed for this part and can be added later).
7. Click Done, and your Service Account, is now created.
8. Click on your service account which should now be displayed after redirection.
9. Click on the tab "Keys".
10. Click on Add Key -> Create new key and select JSON and click create.
11. You will now receive/download your JSON service file, copy it and dont share it with others, as it will work as a direct access to your service account.
12. Create a file named "google-key.json" in the root of the project, the filename needs to be identical as it is set in provider.tf (and later .travis.yml) to look for this file.
13. Paste inn the JSON file you copied in step 11, into the newly created file: google-key.json.
* Now you can/should be able to run the command(s) ```terraform init``` and ```terraform apply``` without issues. And your bucket should be created and available (Note: make sure to be in the init folder when running these commands). To check if you did it correctly: Navigate back to the GCP website and search for Bucket / Storage and it should be displayed under "Storage browser", with the name you gave through the environment variables earlier.
* Note: These steps CAN be done through the terminal, but I find the process tedious and volatile.
## Ex03
* Change bucket name in backend.tf to the one specified earlier through the export/set command. Or check the name of the latest created bucket on the console website.
* Change GCP_PROJECT_ID under .travis.yml -> env-> global, to your own project id.
* Make sure roles mentioned in step 6 of ex02 is applied.
* If you are using travis.com instead of travis.org you need to run the command and login with ```travis login --pro``` first.
* In the root of the project run the command: `````travis encrypt-file google-key.json --add````` This will automatically add the openssl commando to the .travis.yml file. Note: if you are using travis-ci.com swap --add, with --pro. I`ve noticed a "bug" where the travis.com also wont pass sometimes on github if not added with --pro and manually added to .travis.yml, while the .org passes just fine).
* If you did not choose --add in the encrypt-command, an openssl command will be printed in the terminal, copy it and dont lose it!
* Paste this openssl command on a line under --> .travis.yml --> before_install / if there is a similar line, replace it instead.
* Personally had to enable Identity and Access Management API for travis to function properly so I recommend doing this aswell in the Google cloud console website.
* set the travis env TF_ENV before pushing a build.
* Finally commit and push your changes.
1. Either ````git add .```` which should be fine considering the gitignore file in the root of the project. Note: Be absolutely sure you named your key acording to the instructions, or it will get exposed and/or wont get encrypted.
2. ````git commit -m "some random name"````
3. ````git push -u origin master````
